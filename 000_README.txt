1. Transform audio files into mono from stereo using audacity (you can also do it in terminal for batch conversion)
2. Save audio files in the audio folder ('filename_mono.wav')
3. Run example_MK.mat in the mfcc folder. It will take all the .wav files in the audio folder and create csv outputs in the 'output' folder
4. To plot the outputs run extract_mfcc_feature_vectors.R in the output folder.
